<h2>How To Camera</h2>
<pre>
We want photos and videos that capture the fun, chaos, and energy of the event. 
These will be used to make a short 1–2 minute recap video afterwards.

What To Capture:
- Key moments: tasks, challenges, funny reactions
- Energy shots: laughter, reactions, funny faces, dramatic moments
- Action: wide shots of the whole group + close-ups of challenges
- Atmosphere: cheering, clapping, candid behind-the-scenes
- Big reveals: when the Taskmaster announces scores or surprises

Video Tips:
- Keep clips short (10–20 seconds)
- Mix wide shots and close-ups
- Hold the camera steady (use both hands/tripod)
- Move a little to follow the action

Photo Tips:
- Get both key moments and candid laughs
- Capture variety (group, action, close-up)

Your Task:
Capture enough variety and energy to make a fast, fun 
1–2 minute highlight reel.
